# GPT from Scratch with PyTorch

This project is an implementation of a simple GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model from scratch using PyTorch. The model is trained on a text file containing works of Shakespeare and is inspired by the YouTube tutorial by Andrej Karpathy.

## Overview

GPT is a state-of-the-art language model architecture that has shown impressive results in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, text completion, and language understanding. This project aims to build a basic version of GPT from the ground up, using PyTorch, and train it on a dataset of Shakespeare's text.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- tqdm
- Any other necessary libraries mentioned in the tutorial

You can install most of these packages using `pip`. For PyTorch, it's recommended to visit the official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/) for installation instructions tailored to your specific setup.

## Data

The training data for this project is a text file containing Shakespearean text. You can find such datasets online or use the specific dataset used in the YouTube tutorial by Andrej Karpathy. The dataset should be preprocessed to remove any unnecessary formatting or special characters and tokenized into a format that the GPT model can understand.

## Model Architecture

The GPT model consists of a multi-layer transformer architecture with a combination of self-attention layers and feedforward neural networks. It learns to predict the next word in a sequence given the context of the previous words. The model is trained using a variant of the transformer architecture, known as the decoder-only transformer.

## Training

To train the GPT model from scratch, follow these general steps:

1. Preprocess the dataset: Tokenize the text data and convert it into a format that can be used by the GPT model.

2. Build the GPT model: Implement the GPT architecture using PyTorch. This includes creating the transformer layers, positional encodings, and the training loop.

3. Training hyperparameters: Set hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.

4. Training loop: Train the GPT model on the preprocessed Shakespeare text dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or any other suitable optimizer.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance by generating text samples and measuring the model's perplexity on a validation dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download or prepare the Shakespeare text dataset and preprocess it.

3. Modify the hyperparameters and training settings in the code as needed.

4. Run the training script to train the GPT model.

5. After training, you can generate text using the trained model by providing a seed text and allowing the model to continue generating text.
